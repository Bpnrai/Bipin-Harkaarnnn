        <h2>About</h2>
        <p1>Clownfish possess the remarkable ability to undergo sex change. They initially exist as immature males, then
            transition to mature males,
            and ultimately become females. In the wild, a single anemone can house numerous clownfish,
            each differing in size by approximately 20% from the next. The largest individual is always a
            female, followed by the mature male, with the remaining being immature. If a clownfish dies, the others
            below it in size ascend one position in the hierarchy. This transformation typically takes about a month.
            However, once a change has occurred, it is irreversible. Hence, a smaller female cannot revert to being a
            male
            in the presence of a larger female. This is why caution is advised when attempting to pair clownfish at
            home. If you already have
            a female and find a smaller clownfish at the store that has been alone for at least two months, it's likely
            a female. If it was a mature
            male and has been alone for a month, it has probably transitioned to a female. Bringing her home to your
            existing female could lead
            to conflict due to their inability to change back.

            <br>

            There are approximately 30 different species of clownfish, each with slightly different
            habitat preferences. Some species may inhabit different types of anemones or live in slightly
            deeper waters than others. As reef-associated fish, clownfish are typically found within or
            near coral reef ecosystems, which provide them with shelter and a diverse range of food sources.

            Clownfish often choose to lay their eggs near or within the protective tentacles of their
            host anemones. This provides a safe environment for the eggs to develop, with the parents
            guarding them until they hatch.</p>

            <h2>Where clownfish Live?</h2>
            <p>Clownfish can grow up to an approximate length of 4 inches (10 centimeters),
                with the females generally being larger than their male counterparts. Most
                clownfish species are distinguished by their bright white stripes that decorate
                their vividly colored bodies. For both true and false clownfish, the body color is
                primarily orange. Three wide, white bands wrap around the body, and these bands, along with
                the fins, are edged in black. The black edging is more noticeable in true clownfish.

                <br>
                Anemonefish deposit their eggs on any flat surface in close proximity to their host
                anemones. In their natural habitat, anemonefish spawn around the period of the full moon.
                Depending on the species, they can lay hundreds or even thousands of eggs. The male parent safeguards
                the eggs until they hatch
                approximately 6–10 days later, typically two hours post-dusk.

            <h2>Physical Features</h2>
            <p>Clown fish can grow to a length of about 4 inches (10 centimeters). Females are larger than males. Most
                types
                of clown fish have bright white stripes on a colorful body. In true and false clown fish, the body is
                usually orange. Three wide, white bars circle the body. The white bars and the fins are outlined in
                black.
                The black outlines are thicker in true clown fish.

                A thin layer of mucus covers a clown fish’s body. The mucus protects the fish from being stung by its
                host
                anemone.
